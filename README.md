# MEBAnalysis
Analyzing the handcraft culture at the Museu Etnològic de Barcelona

### Research Topic and Objectives
Our project revolves around (some of) the handcraft pieces being displayed in the Museu Etnològic de Barcelona (from now on, MEB). The perfect DH project would integrate each of the pieces registered in their online catalog, but we unfortunately do not have the time or the tools to analyze them all. In consequence, we will only be focusing our study on the pieces retrieved from Spain and the last colonial territories before the 1898 Disaster (these are Cuba, the Philippines, Morocco, the Guam island and Equatorial Guinea).
